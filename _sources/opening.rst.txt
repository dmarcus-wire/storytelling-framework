Core Idea
------------
What is your core idea?
What is the business context?
What message you want to communicate?
How would you write an invitation to think about your idea...
*"What if data science work was easier on Kubernetes?"*
*"Imagine your operations where you could manage the edge like your data center?"*
*"Have you experienced having to update a config file on every system individually?"*
*"Do you ever get faced working code on one system and then failing on a clone?"*
A quote by an author or other authority on the subject can lend validity to the topic.
"developing and deploying ML systems is relatively fast and cheap, but maintaining them over time is difficult and expensive." ~ D. Sculley

Core Message
------------
Core messages describe key ideas or themes and, sometimes, the products or services a company offers. They define company values, goals and the style of language you want to use. Having core messages can help you and your company develop logical and clear narratives to use when devising other storytelling elements.

Sharing personal information about yourself or your company in a business context can help you strengthen the possibility of a connection with consumers. You can use aspects of your background to help you explain why you're making certain decisions. For instance, you may describe how your experiences in a situation caused you to create a product that helps other people who encounter the same circumstances.

Statistics or Research
------------
Statistics or Research why is your core idea important? Outline 2-3 statistics that supports the key message of your post. Data provides important facts and statistics about your customers and how they view a particular product. You can center a story around data you receive to create an accessible context for people who haven't studied the topic you're discussing. To do so, it may be helpful to create a visual component, such as a slideshow presentation or graphic designs. Having efficient data-gathering software can also streamline this process.

It's important to share facts and figures in a way that makes them most obvious. For example, if your presentation is about a new device, be specific about the device's specs, features and capabilities. After you establish the facts, you may share an anecdote or example to provide context about how the benefits users in real life.
