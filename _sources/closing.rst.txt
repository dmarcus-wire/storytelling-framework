The Future
----------
After you resolve a conflict, it's important to let people know you plan to offer more products or services in the future. This alerts people to the fact that the story could have a sequel and they can discover more information about it when they search for the company on the internet or in stores. For instance, you can have a recurring main character appear in a blog post, commercial or paper advertisement who encounters multiple conflicts that your product or service resolves.
