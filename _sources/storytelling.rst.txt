Storytelling
============

Setup
------
Consider placing your characters in a particular and potentially familiar scene to give them some context. These settings can depict a place, time period or a specific circumstance, such as a young person moving out of their childhood home to live in a university dorm. Similar to traditional storytelling, a clear setting helps narrow the focus of the story and move the narrative smoothly through the major plot points.
Include real-world experiences in your stories. Choose anecdotes from your life that relate to your story, or share metaphors or illustrations that provide further context for your story. These additions can make your story more exciting and easier to understand for audiences.

Characters
----------
Consider creating a main character in your story who your audience can understand and support. In a traditional story, these people typically embody traits to which people often aspire, including determination, courage and integrity. If the company's founder is the story's main character, audiences may connect those traits to your brand and associate positive emotions toward it. You could also position the customer as the protagonist and your brand as a side character who helps them achieve their goals.

Obstacle
--------
What is the challenge? pain point? gap today?

Resolution
----------
Present conflict and resolution within your story. Discuss a problem you identified, and reveal your strategy for resolving the issue. Consider sharing the consumer's perspective rather than the companies. For example, tell the story from the perspective of a satisfied customer who had an issue that your product or service solved.
