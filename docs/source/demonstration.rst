Showing information instead of telling audiences about it can be a useful way to relate important facts. This is a common storytelling technique, and you can use it in a corporate environment to provide clear details that immerse people in the content of your story. For instance, you may have an infographic that displays the top ten reasons your business succeeded in the previous year. This graphic can incorporate photos, statistics and quotes from individuals to explain these facts.
